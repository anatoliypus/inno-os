As we can see, average time of execution of ex3 is smaller.

I think, that is because of mutex. The process, which uses it,
blocks the execution of other threads, which makes a delay in
running.

The main idea of time becoming smaller, when the amount of
threads is increased, has already been described in 
ex3.explanation.txt.
