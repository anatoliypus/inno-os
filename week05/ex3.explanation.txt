In the ex3.txt file we are actually interested only in 
'real' column, which displays the actual time of 
execution. We see, that if the amount of threads
increases, then the execution time decreases.

Actually, I have a multicore processor (4 CPUs). My system
knows it, and when a program, which has several threads,
executes, system will give to the program resources
to run on different cores. This ability reduces execution
time.

Also I`ve tried to run this program on a virtual machine
(Ubuntu) with only one CPU available. The 'real' execution
times were pretty much the same in each row.
