Physical memory is a set of addresses, which are related to
actual cells of system memory (RAM).

Virtual memory is an abstraction, which gives the programmer
an illusion of large system memory or RAM. It is used, when a
programm needs more space, than RAM can suggest. At that moment,
some pages from RAM are transfered between RAM and hard disk.
