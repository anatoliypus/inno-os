In the lecture we`ve discussed three methods:
    1) Preemption
    2) Rollback
    3) Killing processes

1) In preemption we temporarily take resources away from one process and
give them to another. This technique works great if it is easy to make
such swithces of resources

2) In rollback we downgrade to a certain state, where the process started using
the needed resource (to the checkpoint). After using the resource, it will be given
back and the stopped process will restart from the checkpoint. I think this
is an improved preemption. May be it will avoid losing some data.

3) Killing processes is a simple technique, when we just kill some process to
get resources for a deadlocked process. It works good, when killed process
can be rerunned after a while without any ill effects.
