In each iteration in each process a new child process is created.
So if we have one process in the beginning, this process will create a new one (1 => 2).
Then we have to processes. 
Each process will make an iteration and two new child processses will be created.
We can conclude that after each iteration the amount of processes doubles =>
=> the amount of processes in the end = 2^n, where n is amount of iterations.

So for the case with n=3, the result is 2^3=8
                     n=5, the result is 2^5=32.
