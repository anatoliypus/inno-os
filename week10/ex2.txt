The simplest idea, which came to my mind is following:
Let`s just sort our pages. 

With this approach, all references to a certain page will come one 
after another, because all pages in input file are sorted, same pages 
are located nearby. This guarantees increasing of hit/miss ratio, 
because starting from the 2nd reference, page will always be in memory, 
because it has already been referenced one tick ago.
