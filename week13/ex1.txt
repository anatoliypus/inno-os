Unfortunately this is all the data, which was in /proc/ioports on my machine.
I think this is somehow related to the fact, that I use virtual machine
(or may be because I use arm64 Linux, i do not know).
I`ve also checked what should be here, so below you can check the explanations.

dma stands for Direct Memory Access device. This thing helps CPU with controlling some of
I/O devices by working with this I/O controllers.

pic stands for programmable interrupt controller. This thing helps CPU to handle interrupt 
requests from I/O devices. From this port you can get values, which are used to determine, 
which interrupts will cause the CPU to be interrupted.

timer is programmable interval timer, which is a counter that generates an output signal
when it reaches a programmed count. This output signal may trigger an interrupt.
